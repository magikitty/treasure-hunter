# Self-evaluation

- Getting levels to load with a new map and new gems, monsters and magic apples was initially difficult.
- I think my GameManager and LevelManager classes came out well and I am happy with the game is managed and levels 
  are loaded.
- Splitting functionality between the Level class and LevelManager class was difficult at times because I was not 
  sure which class some functionality should go into and had to make getters and setters in the LevelManager to get 
  Level members.
- Deciding which class should handle interactions between the player and the other game objects was a little 
  difficult, but I ended up splitting this functionality between the Player class and the GameManager class, which 
  worked well.
- Planning the project in the beginning was also a little tricky, but I think overall the project went well and my 
  game functions as it should.
